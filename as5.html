									<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									<div class="sub-section">
										<h3 class="subsection-header">Load Balancing and Service Discovery using Apache Curator</h3>
										<p>The implementation of load balancing and service
											discovery will provide flexibility in terms of the metric for
											load balancing, but this flexibility comes with extra effort
											required to implement the load balancing. Along with the
											fact that the load balancing and service discovery is tightly
											coupled with the API Server and the client. Considering
											these facts and performance effect because of two requests
											need to be sent for a single request, this approach in its
											current form should not be used for load balancing and
											service discovery for bringing scalability and fault
											tolerance to API server.</p>

										<h3 class="subsection-header">User Interface Development Approach </h3>
										<p>Comparing the 2 approaches of single page application
											and hybrid approach, the hybrid approach provides all the
											advantages by single page application along with added
											flexibility of choosing the technologies and framework for
											development independently. Hence the hybrid approach is
											the desired way for the user interface development.</p>

									<div class="sub-section">
										<h3 class="subsection-header">Distributed Caching</h3>
										<p>Performance benchmarks for the django application with
											memcached and Redis, shows an interesting thing. In this
											benchmark, the insight that was obtained was that the
											performance difference for both Redis and Memcached
											based caching were quite similar for upto 10000 requests.
											Even so Redis is a better Distributed cache since it has in
											built fault tolerance and scalability which Memcached
											lacks, since it relies a lot on the client for the same.</p>
