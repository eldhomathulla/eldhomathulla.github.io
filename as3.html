				<h3 class="subsection-header">What level of caching should be used?</h3>
				<p>In Django, there are multiple places where the caching can be implemented. These are as follows:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Views</li>
					<li>Request response</li>
					<li>Model Objects</li>
					<li>Database query results</li>
					<li>Thrift calls</li>
				</ol>
				<div class="sub-2-section">
					<h4>Views</h4>
					<p>
    					In caching of views whatâ€™s done is that the result a call to a view will be cached. The advantage of this approach is that since the views encompass all the things that can be cached, caching the view itself will cache everything relative to the corresponding view. It might possibly eliminate a need for caching in other areas, depending on the use case.
					</p>
					<p>
    					Django's default caching mechanism provides caching for dynamic pages which may be created from data obtained from multiple sources. Django by default provides multiple sources as a data store for caching, such as external files, Memcache, database and local memory caching. Apart from the default caching available in Django, a Redis based cache for the same has been implemented, so as to provide an alternative to Memcache for Distributed Caching.
					</p>
					<p>
    					The main problem with this level of caching is that since the pages are cached, there is very little granularity of the things cached. I.e. all the shared data used between different pages will be essentially be cached multiple times, which make it redundant. Also, this level of caching will be irrelevant when most of the UI processing is done on the client side and not Django backend.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="sub-2-section">
					<h4>Request reponse</h4>
					<p>
    					Within the Django caching framework, it allows for caching of the response to the corresponding request.This means that everything including the views will be cached without any distinction.This has a clear advantage over the caching of the views where any the caching can be applied effectively to cases where most of the UI processing is done on the client side, which in most cases means that Django provides APIs for fetching data required by the UI, which can be cached using this level of caching. This level of caching shares the same Django caching framework.
