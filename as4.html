									<h2>Distributed Caching in Django</h2>
									<div class="sub-section">
										<h3 class="subsection-header">Goal</h3>
										<p>Main goal of this is to find the possible cache storage that be used in django for the purpose of Distributed Caching.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="sub-section">
										<h3 class="subsection-header">Possible Solutions</h3>
										<p>For the purpose of distributed caching 2 cache storage options were considered.
											<ul>
												<li>Memcached</li>
												<li>Redis</li>
											</ul>
											<h4>Memcached</h4>
											<p>Memcached [7] is a distributed cache store which is
												explicitly made for caching purpose. Memcached instances
												themselves do not have any distributed system ability.
												Instead everything is managed by the client interacting with
												the Memcached. The client takes decisions regarding which
												cache the data should be stored at, and for replication
												purpose, the client sends the same request to other
												Memcached instances.
												Django by default has support for Memcached.
												Therefore, we can simply specify the set of Memcached
												instances urls, that need to be used in the Django settings.</p>
											<h4>Redis</h4>
											<p>
												Redis [8] is distributed key value pair data store which
												can be used for distributed caching. The main aspect of
												Redis that allows it to be used as a cache storage is the key
												value pair storage approach of the redis. Unlike
												Memcached, Redis is a fully distributed highly available
												application by itself.
												Django does not directly provide support for Redis as
												cache store. Therefore a custom cache store which
												implements the cache store api of Django needs to be
												implemented or other third party Redis cache store for
												django can be used.
												Redis can be setup in multiple ways, like in standalone
												mode, master slave mode or as a cluster. In Standalone
												mode there is just a single Redis instance. In this mode
												Redis is not a highly available distributed system.
												In a master slave mode, there is single master instance
												and multiple slave instances. These slave instances store
												the exact data as the master, i.e it replicates the data from
												the master. This aspect of Redis is used for fault tolerance
												and high availability in Redis .
												In Redis cluster, there can be multiple masters & slaves
												where certain key value pair will be stored only in certain
												master slaves and not others i.e. it splits the storage of data
												among multiple redis masters in the cluster.
												Considering fault tolerance, lets the replication of data in
												master is not enough, since when a master goes down, a
												new master needs to take its place. In order to achieve that,
												Redis provides another mode of operation called Sentinel
												[9]. In this mode, Redis essentially monitors Redis masters
												and checks if master is alive at regular intervals. If certain
												Redis sentinels reach a consensus that a master is down,
												then a new master is elected from the slaves and the elected
												slave is made a master and rest of the slaves are
												synchronized with the new master. During the brief period
												of master going down and new master election, few request
												may be lost as not all requests processed by the master may
												be propagated to the slaves because of eventual consistency
												of Redis.
												For caching purpose here we have used a simple master
												slave mode, where a new slave can be added by simply
												providing the master's address which will be provided by
												sentinels. The configuration of cache store is
												straightforward where the address of master is provided.

											<h3 class="subsection-header">Redis vs Memecached</h3>
											<p>Before getting into actual evaluations of the test results between Redis and Memcached implementation. These are the few things I observer during implememntaion of Redis and memcached cache storage in django.</p>
											<h4><u>Cache sharing between multiple django instances</u></h4>
											<p>One of the major issue that I found during a simple set up for testing if the cache has been shared by multiple instances, is that for some reason, it was not happening.
												This was because the django caching frameowrk generate keys for each caching where it incluse information specific to the instance like its particular url details and absolute path of the  cache.
												To mitigate this issue, I have implemented a custom cache extending django current caching framework to generate keys without server specific information, so that multple server can access the sam cache for the sam request.
											</p>
											<h4><u>Comparison</u></h4>
											<p>Performance benchmarks for the django application with
												memcached and Redis, shows an interesting thing. In this
												benchmark, the insight that was obtained was that the
												performance difference for both Redis and Memcached
												based caching were quite similar for upto 10000 requests.
												Even so Redis is a better Distributed cache since it has in
												built fault tolerance and scalability which Memcached
												lacks, since it relies a lot on the client for the same.</p>
